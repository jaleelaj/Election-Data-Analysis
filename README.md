# Election Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing election data to gain insights into voting patterns, turnout, and other important metrics. The analysis focuses on cleaning and processing the data, dealing with missing values, and generating meaningful statistics.

## Project Structure

- `Projects Election Data Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code and analysis steps.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/election-data-analysis.git
   cd election-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries:**

   Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, the primary libraries you might need include:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Loading the Data:**
   - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Missing values in the `totvotpoll` column are filled with the mean of the column, rounded to the nearest integer:
     
     ```python
     data['totvotpoll'] = data['totvotpoll'].fillna(round(data['totvotpoll'].mean()))
     ```

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Various statistical methods are applied to understand voting patterns, including mean calculations, distribution analysis, and more.

4. **Visualization:**
   - The project may include visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data trends.

## Results

- The analysis provides insights into voter turnout, patterns across different regions, and other relevant metrics.
- The results can be used to draw conclusions about electoral behavior and make informed predictions or recommendations.
